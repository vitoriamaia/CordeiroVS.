Switch to another user account quickly.

== Description ==

It's a plugin for developers.
The intent is create a simple interface where the logged user can switch to another user account.

This make tests and debug infos more fast (especially when you are working with different roles). 

For security:

* Only logged users can switch user accounts in website with WP_DEBUG false.
* Passwords are not revealed (of course).
* Uses the cookie authentication function 'wp_set_auth_cookie' to switch accounts.
* Implements the nonce security system (of course).

Obs: For now, the interface appears only in website, not in dashboard.

== Installation ==

Through the panel:

1. Go to the Plugins menu and click Add New.
1. Search for Switch User.
1. Click 'Install Now' next to the Switch User plugin.
1. Activate the plugin.

Uploading by yourself:

1. Upload the entire switch-user folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory or the .zip file in Plugins menu.
1. Activate the plugin.
